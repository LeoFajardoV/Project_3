RECOMENDATIONS WITH IBM

My third project was developed taking into account the following items or sections that I briefly explain below:

I. Exploratory data analysis
Before making recommendations of any kind, you should explore the data that you are working with for the project. Hence some robust indicators and histograms are looked at.

II. Range-based recommendations
Before making a recommendation, the most popular articles are verified within the database, where interactions between users and articles are simply verified, and this would be the way to recommend some articles to users.

III. Collaborative filtering based on user-user
The best recommendations are based on finding culusters or similar users, that is, they have looked for common topics, in order to recommend the same articles to those users.

IV. Content-based recommendations (EXTRA - NOT NECESSARY)
Given the amount of content available for each article, there are a number of different ways that someone can choose to implement a content-based recommendation system. Using your NLP skills, you can find some extremely creative ways to develop a content-based recommendation system. You are encouraged to complete a content-based recommendation system, but you do not need to do so to complete this project.

V.  Matrix factoring
Finally, you will complete a machine learning approach to create recommendations. Using the user-element interactions, you will build a matrix decomposition. Using your decomposition, you will get an idea of how well you can predict the new items a person might interact with (spoiler alert, not great). Finally, you will discuss what methods you could use in the future, and how you could test how well your recommendations are working to attract users.
